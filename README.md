# ObjectListView

.NET ListView on caffeine, guarana and steroids.

ObjectListView is a C# wrapper around a .NET ListView. It makes the ListView much easier to use and teaches it some neat new tricks.

Larry Wall, the author of Perl, once wrote that the three essential character flaws of any good programmer were sloth, impatience and hubris. Good programmers want to do the minimum amount of work (sloth). They want their programs to run quickly (impatience). They take inordinate pride in what they have written (hubris).

ObjectListView encourages the vices of sloth and hubris, by allowing programmers to do far less work but still produce great looking results.
